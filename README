This is example code showing the theoretical implementation of an OAuth authentication
adapter for Zend Framework.  There are 2 separate implementations of this adapter.

The first is for ZF 1.x releases.  The other is for the impending ZF 2.0 release.

This code corresponds to the proposal for the Zend_Auth_Adapter_Twitter 
component.

The example code for ZF1 was created using Zend Framework 1.11.  Download this yourself 
and put the Zend/ folder in the library folder.

Also, you will need to rename /example/config.example.php to /example/config.php.

You will need to register your application with Twitter.com.  To do so, go to
http://twitter.com/apps/ and "Register a new Application".  You will get a 
consumer key and secret, which you will need to put into the config.php file
you just created.  Also, you will need to provide a callback URL.  For this 
example, it is http://{whatever your URL is}/zf[1 or 2]/example/auth.php.
