This code corresponds to the proposal for the Zend_Auth_Adapter_Twitter 
component.

http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Auth_Adapter_Twitter+-+Jason+Austin

The example code was created using Zend Framework 1.11.  Download this yourself 
and put the Zend/ folder in the library folder.

Also, you will need to rename /example/config.example.php to /example/config.php.

You will need to register your application with Twitter.com.  To do so, go to
http://twitter.com/apps/ and "Register a new Application".  You will get a 
consumer key and secret, which you will need to put into the config.php file
you just created.  Also, you will need to provide a callback URL.  For this 
example, it is http://{whatever your URL is}/example/auth.php.
